### Versioning

In order to provide a consistent UX with token lists, we shall update our token list following the rules defined [here](https://github.com/uniswap/token-lists#semantic-versioning):

> List versions must follow the rules:
>
> - Increment major version when tokens are removed or new details/tags are added
> - Increment minor version when tokens are added
> - Increment patch version when tokens already on the list have minor details changed (name, symbol, logo URL, decimals)
